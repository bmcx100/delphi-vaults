How It Works Page — Implementation Guide
Follow each step in order. Match all styling (fonts, colors, spacing, components) to the existing site pages.

Step 1: Create the Page File & Route

Create a new page file: HowItWorks.tsx (or .jsx) in the same directory as existing pages.
Add a route for /how-it-works in the router config (same file/pattern used for other pages).
Import the shared layout wrapper (header, footer, nav) used by other pages.
Verify the page loads at /how-it-works with placeholder text before continuing.


Step 2: Build the Hero / Simple Overview Section
This is the top section the user sees first.

Add a page heading: "How It Works" — use the same heading component/style as other page titles on the site.
Add a subheading: "Earn through automated vaults"
Build a 3-step flow diagram arranged horizontally (stack vertically on mobile):

StepLabelDescription1DepositDeposit supported tokens into a DELPHI vault. No strategy selection. No protocol management.2Vault AutomationThe vault automatically allocates capital across integrated DeFi protocols, managing positions in real time.3Earn & WithdrawRewards are compounded automatically. Withdraw your funds at any time — no lockups.

Connect the three steps visually with arrows (→) or a connector line between them.
Below each step box, add a short caption:

Step 1: "Deposit tokens"
Step 2: "Auto-allocate & rebalance"
Step 3: "Compound + exit"



Styling notes:

Reuse any card or box component from the existing site.
Use the site's existing icon set if available (e.g., wallet icon for Deposit, gear/loop icon for Automation, arrow-up/check icon for Earn).
The flow should feel like a pipeline: left-to-right on desktop, top-to-bottom on mobile.


Step 3: Build the "How the Vaults Work (Technical)" Section
This section has 5 subsections. Use an accordion/collapsible pattern if the site already has one; otherwise use stacked content blocks with clear subheadings.
3a — Vault Architecture

Subheading: "Vault architecture"
Content:

Each vault is a non-custodial smart contract system designed to deploy user capital across multiple yield-generating strategies while minimizing manual intervention and operational risk. Vaults do not rely on a single protocol or position. Instead, they dynamically manage capital across a set of predefined strategies.



3b — Capital Allocation

Subheading: "Capital allocation"
Content — describe the deposit flow:

Funds are pooled inside the vault contract.
Capital is allocated across integrated protocols based on predefined strategy logic.
Allocation weights adjust over time as conditions change.


Then list protocol types:

Lending markets
Liquidity pools
Fee-generating automated market maker positions



3c — Automation & Rebalancing

Subheading: "Automation & rebalancing"
Content — vaults continuously perform:

Rebalancing positions to maintain target exposure
Adjusting liquidity ranges where applicable
Migrating capital between strategies when risk or yield profiles change


Add note: "All actions are executed automatically via smart contracts."

3d — Compounding & Gas Optimization

Subheading: "Compounding & gas optimization"
Content:

Rewards are periodically harvested
Returns are reinvested back into the vault
Actions are batched to reduce gas costs per user


Add note: "This allows vaults to compound yield efficiently without requiring manual claims."

3e — Risk Controls

Subheading: "Risk controls"
Content — each vault operates within defined constraints:

Strategy allocation limits
Exposure caps per protocol
Automated guards to prevent undesired states


Add note: "Vault parameters can be updated as protocols or market conditions evolve."


Step 4: Build the "User Control" Section
Two sub-blocks side by side (or stacked on mobile):
4a — Non-custodial by design

Users retain ownership of their assets at all times.
Vaults cannot withdraw user funds without user interaction.
Withdrawals are permissionless and available at any time.

4b — Transparency

Vault positions are fully on-chain.
Performance and allocations can be tracked in real time.
No hidden leverage or off-chain activity.

Styling notes:

If the site has a two-column feature block or icon+text grid, reuse it here.
Consider using a lock/shield icon for "Non-custodial" and an eye/chain icon for "Transparency."


Step 5: Add the Summary & CTA

Add a short summary line: "One deposit. Fully automated yield."
Below it, add a secondary line: "DELPHI vaults abstract away protocol complexity while preserving transparency, control, and flexibility."
Add a prominent CTA button: "View Vaults" — link it to the vaults page (use the same button component and style as other primary CTAs on the site).


Step 6: Responsive & Polish

Mobile breakpoints: Ensure the 3-step flow stacks vertically. Technical subsections should be full-width. The two-column User Control section should stack.
Spacing: Match vertical spacing (padding/margins between sections) to other pages.
Animations (optional): If other pages use scroll-triggered animations (fade-in, slide-up), apply the same to each section here.
Navigation: Add "How It Works" to the site nav/menu in the correct position.
